Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux desktop environments. It comes with a lot of software, and is super easy to use.

- initial.sh: Preps Ubuntu for running the other scripts
- tensorflow.sh: Build TensorFlow from source and install it as a Python3 package.
- python3.sh: Adds all my favorite packages to Python3 (make sure to get up to date ones!)
